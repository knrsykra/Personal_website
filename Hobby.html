<h3>What are your hobby and interests?</h3>
<p style="background-color: burlywood;">If I need to explain about my hobby, I would say that my hobby is watching korean drama. It is not a shocking news when we heard one hobby is watching kdrama. I believe half of the world population shared the same hobby as mine. I began watching kdrama when I was 10 years old. My first kdrama is "You Are Beautiful" with their main casting was Park Shinhye and Jang Geun Seuk.</p>

<p style="background-color: burlywood;">My personal rate is <b>6/10</b> for this kdrama as it holds special memory in my heart as I first watch it with my sister. </p>

<p style="background-color: burlywood;">My next favorite kdrama is "18 Again". This a real tear-jerking drama about parenthood. Watching this make me appreciate my parents more as the casts act really well. Definitely need a box of tissue on every episode.</p>
<p style="background-color: burlywood;">My personal rating is DEFINITELY <b>10/10</b>. Will rewatch if I don't have any watchlist. </p>

<p style="background-color: burlywood;">Feel burnt out and emotional exhausted? You should try watching "My Mister".Stories involve with three middle-age sibling who's life is not that happy although their job pays well. One day, the male lead, Kang-hoon receives bribe and it was witnessed by his contract worker, Lee Ji-An. Since then, people began to pay attention towards Ji-An although she was merely a shadow before.</p>
<p style="background-color: burlywood;">My personal rating is DEFINITELY <b>1000/10</b>. Cried a river watching its final episode.</p>
